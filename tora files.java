Tomorrow X Together (Korean: 투모로우바이투게더, Japanese: トゥモローバイトゥギャザ-; Tomorrow by Together, stylized in all caps), commonly known as TXT (/ˈtiː-ˈɛks-ˈtiː/ TEE-eks-tee), is a South Korean boy band formed by Big Hit Entertainment, now known as Big Hit Music. The group consists of five members: Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and HueningKai.[2]

They debuted on March 4, 2019, with the extended play (EP) The Dream Chapter: Star. The EP debuted and peaked at number one on the Gaon Album Chart and Billboard World Albums Chart and entered the US Billboard 200 at number 140, the highest-charting debut album by any male K-pop group at the time. Its lead single "Crown" debuted at number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. The group also topped the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. TXT was the first Korean act to perform at Lollapalooza, one of the biggest music festivals in the US.

The group's early commercial success earned them several new artist awards, including Rookie of the Year at the 34th Golden Disc Awards and the 2019 Melon Music Awards, New Artist of the Year at the 9th Gaon Chart Music Awards and Best New Male Artist at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards.

Name
TXT is an acronym for Tomorrow X Together.[3] In Korean, the group's name is 투모로우바이투게더 ,[4] read as "Tomorrow by Together" and transliterated into Hangul; they do not have a separate Korean version of their name.[5] According to their website, their name refers to five individuals who "come together under one dream in hopes of building a better tomorrow".[6]

In their first interview with MBC's Section TV, the group stated that they prefer to be called "Tomorrow X Together" over "TXT".[7]
